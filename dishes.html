    <h1>DISHES</h1>
    <p>The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters. I had the white asparagus accompanied by a mousseline sauce and poached eggs, while my friend tried the zucchini carpaccio served with sundries tomatoes and a mozzarella strudel. They were exquisite. The main course consisted in a risotto with scallop cooked in cream followed by a delicious apple pie served with scoop of vanilla ice cream for desert.</p>
